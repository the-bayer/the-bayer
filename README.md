Hello! My name is Blake and I'm a junior full stack software developer. 
- I'll be working for Flight Control within a couple weeks.
- I'm currently finishing up my learning (I was an RN prior to this), but it's just the basics, so I'll still have a long way to go!

I'm really excited to be on this journey!
